Write a JavaScript program to map Employee Records according to Employee
IDs.
Employee: { id, name, salary }
a) Print an array of all employee ids
b) Print count of employees
c) Print the name of the employee according to their id { key: value }
d) Store the salaries of all employees in an array
e) Calculate the average salary the company is paying to its employees



Sample Input:
"id": [ 67, 48, 29 ]
"name": [ "Hitanshu", “Ninad”, “Amandeep” ]
"salary": [ 75000, 82000, 98000 ]
Output:
[ 67, 48, 29 ]
3
67: Hitanshu
48: Ninad
29: Amandeep
[ 75000, 82000, 98000 ]
85000


Ans: 
                                            // Sample Input
const ids = [67, 48, 29];
const names = ["Hitanshu", "Ninad", "Amandeep"];
const salaries = [75000, 82000, 98000];


                                           // Function to print an array of all employee IDs
function printEmployeeIDs() {
  console.log(ids);
}

                                             // Function to print the count of employees
function printEmployeeCount() {
  console.log(ids.length);
}

                                          // Function to print the name of the employee according to their ID
function printEmployeeNames() {
  let employeeNameMap = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
    employeeNameMap[ids[i]] = names[i];
  }
  console.log(employeeNameMap);
}


                                                  // Function to store the salaries of all employees in an array
function storeSalaries() {
  console.log(salaries);
}

                                              // Function to calculate the average salary of the company's employees
function calculateAverageSalary() {
  const totalSalary = salaries.reduce((sum, salary) => sum + salary, 0);
  const averageSalary = totalSalary / salaries.length;
  console.log(averageSalary);
}

// Call the functions

     // a) Print an array of all employee IDs

printEmployeeIDs();

            // b) Print count of employees
printEmployeeCount();

             // c) Print the name of the employee according to their ID
printEmployeeNames();

              // d) Store the salaries of all employees in an array
storeSalaries();

              // e) Calculate the average salary the company is paying to its employees.
calculateAverageSalary();



output:

{
  67: "Hitanshu",
  48: "Ninad",
  29: "Amandeep"
}
